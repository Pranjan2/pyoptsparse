To install the pyOptSparse package in a folder on the Python search path (usually in a python site-packages or dist-packages folder) run:
python3 setup.py install --user

This will install the package to ~/.local which is typically found automatically by Python. 

To reinstall, clear build ( rm -rf build ) and repeat above steps

Note : Set correct CC and CXX flags in setup.py
